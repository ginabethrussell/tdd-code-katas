# About Me

Hi! I'm Gina Beth, a former educator now working as a Software Engineer. I currently work full stack with Typescript, React, Node, Express, REST, GraphQL, and Postgres.

I am passionate about improving my craft. When introduced to the idea of Katas for developers in the book [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) by Robert C. Martin, the idea really resonated with me. 

To help facilitate practicing programming with others, I decided to create this shared space.

If you have questions or comments, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gina-beth-russell/)

Enjoy the exercises and have fun!
